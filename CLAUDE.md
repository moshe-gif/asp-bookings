# App Starter Kit — Engineering Guide (CLAUDE.md)

## What this is
A starting template for a single-author internal/ops web tool. Two deployables:
- **Frontend:** one static `frontend/index.html` — **vanilla JS, no build step, no framework.**
  Global `S` state object; `render()` rebuilds views via `innerHTML`; delegated `data-action`
  handlers; `data-field`→form-model input mapping; `esc()` on ALL HTML interpolation. PWA
  (manifest + icons + service worker). Data via a backend proxy and/or a hosted DB over REST.
- **Backend:** `backend/proxy.js` — Node, **no dependencies**. Holds all third-party API keys
  server-side, gates every `/api/*` route behind verified auth, encrypts secrets at rest.

Deploy = SFTP a single file up (`deploy/deploy-index.js` / `deploy-proxy.js`). Never hand-roll SFTP.

Wiring in any third-party capability (email, payments, maps, browser automation, scheduled jobs,
LLM, push, PDF…)? **Read `INTEGRATIONS.md` first** — it catalogs every option with the proven
picks and the gotchas already paid for.

## Deploy discipline (learned the hard way)
The deploy scripts OVERWRITE the live file with the local copy. If the live file was ever
hot-patched in place (emergency fix applied directly on the server), a deploy from a stale local
template silently regresses production. Rules:
- Every change lands in the repo copy FIRST; hot patches on the server are an emergency measure
  that must be back-ported to the repo the same day.
- Before any backend deploy, diff the live file against the local one (download it or `ssh cat`);
  investigate any difference you didn't write.
- Take a dated server-side backup (`proxy.js.bak-YYYYMMDD`) before overwriting.

## Engineering Priorities (read before planning any PR)
1. **Elegance.** Completely, directly, simply solve the problem. Reuse an existing convention
   over inventing one; delete/strangle bad patterns rather than duplicate them. No band-aids
   that leave the root cause in place.
2. **Limit blast radius and downstream-bug risk.** Fewest call sites, local + additive +
   reversible changes; preserve out-of-scope behavior. Replace patterns strangler-fig (new path
   beside old → migrate → remove old last), never big-bang rewrites.
3. **Scope in user-meaningful arcs.** An arc = the minimum to end-to-end test a real user-facing
   capability against the REAL thing (no mocks/sims). Atomic commits; tightly-scoped PRs; split
   sequential work into ordered waves.
4. **Double-review high-risk work** (agent-review team + your own hand) before merge.
5. **Verify on the REAL app** (browser/backend), not just that it compiles. Report outcomes
   faithfully — if something is unverified, say so.
6. **Single source of truth.** Before adding state/a collection, confirm the concept isn't already
   owned somewhere. Never create a second source of truth.

## Security (non-negotiable)
- **HTTPS everywhere, always.** Never ship plain HTTP. Static hosts give automatic TLS; on a
  server use nginx + Let's Encrypt with a force-HTTPS redirect + HSTS. See SETUP.md.
- **Never trust the client.** The server validates everything. Any client-side gate (e.g. a PIN)
  is convenience only and must NOT be the real authorization boundary.
- **Secrets live server-side only.** API keys never reach the browser — the proxy injects them.
  Encrypt sensitive tokens at rest (AES-256-GCM; key in a separate `0600` file or a secrets store).
- **Gate every `/api/*` route** behind verified auth (e.g. a verified identity-provider ID token,
  signature-checked, with issuer/audience/expiry + an allowlist). Mark privileged routes admin-only.
- **Lock CORS** to the app's own origin (not `*`). **Rate-limit** the proxy.
- **Guard against SSRF** on any server-side fetch (allowlist hosts, block private IPs).
- **Hardware/financial-control APIs (e.g. vehicle command, payments): treat the signing/secret key
  as a crown jewel** — server-only, encrypted, admin-gated, rate-limited, audit-logged, with explicit
  confirmation for actuating commands; request minimum OAuth scopes; never log tokens.

## UI aesthetic (corporate/professional SaaS, never cheesy)
- One brand accent color used sparingly (active states, primary actions); everything else a neutral
  gray/off-white scale with tiered text hierarchy. Pick concrete colors per project.
- Soft depth, not gloss: small-to-medium radius, low-opacity layered shadows, hairline borders.
- Typography: Inter/system for body; a distinct display face for big numbers/titles; UPPERCASE
  micro-labels with letter-spacing for stat labels / table headers / section labels. Antialiased.
- Data-dense but breathable; subtle ~.15–.2s transitions and tiny hover lift only.
- Mobile = native-app feel (bottom nav, safe-area insets, bottom-sheet modals), not a shrunk desktop.
- Avoid: loud gradients, neon glows, shadow overload, decorative emoji chrome, blobby shapes,
  comic fonts, skeuomorphism, gimmicky animation. When unsure, choose the more restrained option.

## When to abandon "no build step"
No-build single-file is correct for internal tools with known/trusted users, and scales to many
users — user COUNT doesn't force a build. Step up to a real framework + build step when the app
gains: untrusted external users, a large/growing feature set, hard first-load performance needs,
public/SEO pages, npm UI libraries, or multiple developers. The line is COMPLEXITY + UNTRUSTED
USERS, not user count. For untrusted users the real change is the SECURITY/auth architecture.

## Communication: explain big decisions
For any significant decision (architecture, security tradeoff, tooling pick, anything non-trivial),
explain it in simple English first — WHAT and WHY — then give the technical term(s) in parentheses,
and define jargon inline. Keep it a natural parenthetical, not a lecture. Ask fewer questions; act on
routine choices, but explain the meaningful ones.

## PR Process
1. Re-read the priorities + security rules above.
2. Plan the arc: capability, minimum features to e2e-test it for real, atomic commits, waves.
3. Assess blast radius: list call sites touched + what could break; mark high-risk for double-review.
4. Implement (elegance + blast-radius rules).
5. Review the diff: correctness, scope creep, SSOT violations, security.
6. Test against the real deployed app; loop-fix until green.
7. Verify live, then deploy via the deploy scripts.
